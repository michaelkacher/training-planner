## Development Notes

### Key Decisions

**Svelte 5 Upgrade (2025-10-19):**
- Upgraded from Svelte 4 to Svelte 5 for modern reactivity
- Required Node.js 20+ (upgraded from Node 18)
- Updated to use runes: `$state()`, `$derived()`, `$effect()`
- Changed from `<slot />` to `{@render children?.()}`

**Mock Mode Implementation (2025-10-19):**
- Added fallback to in-memory storage when database not configured
- Allows development without Supabase setup
- Graceful error handling for missing credentials
- Console warnings guide users to database setup

**CORS Configuration (2025-10-19):**
- Changed from single port to allow all localhost ports
- Fixes issues when Vite auto-selects different ports
- Maintains security in production mode

### Issues Resolved

**"Unexpected end of JSON input" (2025-10-19):**
- Cause: Backend crashed when Supabase credentials invalid
- Fix: Added mock mode with in-memory storage
- Benefit: App works immediately without setup

**Port conflicts (2025-10-19):**
- Created `kill-ports.bat` and `kill-ports.ps1`
- Automated process killing for common ports
- Documented manual resolution steps

**Svelte 5 compatibility (2025-10-19):**
- Fixed layout file to use Svelte 5 syntax
- Updated components to use runes
- Documented Svelte 4 vs 5 differences

### Migration Path

From Svelte 4 to Svelte 5:
```typescript
// Before
let count = 0;
$: doubled = count * 2;

// After
let count = $state(0);
let doubled = $derived(count * 2);
```

From `<slot />` to snippets:
```svelte
<!-- Before -->
<slot />

<!-- After -->
<script>
  let { children } = $props();
</script>
{@render children?.()}
```

### Performance Improvements

- Svelte 5: ~40% smaller bundle sizes
- Fastify 5: Better async performance
- Mock mode: No database latency in development
- Hot reload: Instant feedback during development

### Security Considerations

**Current (Development):**
- Mock mode active by default
- No authentication required
- CORS allows all localhost
- Demo athlete_id used

**Production TODO:**
- Enable Supabase Row Level Security
- Add authentication (Supabase Auth)
- Restrict CORS to production domain
- Implement proper user sessions
